# Hole-in-the-Ground

![Game Screenshot](./screenshot.png)  

A fun 3D physics video game inspired by the 2018 indie game **Donut County** by Ben Esposito.  
In this game, you control a magical hole in the ground that grows as objects fall into it, eventually swallowing larger objects and buildings.

> Note: 1. This repository hosts a **GitHub Pages site**, which consists only of the files in the `dist` folder.
> 
> 2. The `dist` folder contains the **official build** generated by running `npm run build` on the source code.
> 
> 3. The JavaScript in this folder has been obfuscated and is not human-readable.

## üéÆ Game Controls

- **Move the Hole:**  
  - WASD keys or arrow keys  
  - Mouse / touch input  
- **Objective:** Swallow smaller objects first to grow large enough to capture bigger ones.

## ‚ú® Features

1. **Hole Control and Boundaries**  
   - Hole moves on X-Z plane  
   - Boundary checks prevent leaving the playable area

2. **Physics Simulation**  
   - Moving spheres with simplified rigid body dynamics  
   - Gravity causes spheres to fall naturally  
   - Friction applied on bounces  

3. **Collision Handling**  
   - Boundary collisions: spheres bounce back without penetrating walls  
   - Sphere-sphere collisions: resolved using collision normals and relative velocities  

4. **Custom Levels**  
   - At least 8 spheres of varying sizes per stage  
   - Winning requires strategic capture of smaller spheres first  
   - Supports creative arrangements (e.g., Rube Goldberg style puzzles)  

5. **Official Build for Deployment**  
   - TypeScript code compiled and bundled into a `dist` folder  
   - Ready for deployment on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build and Run Locally

To build and run the game locally, you need the **source code**.  
The `dist` folder alone cannot be rebuilt or edited, as it only contains the compiled output.
The source code of the project is also stored in a git repository, but it is private. I'm just writing here about its usage.

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed
- [GopherGfx](https://github.com/djanderson07/GopherGfx) library

### Installation
Here's some code you can use on the command line:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YilingSuun/Hole-in-the-Ground-Source-Code.git
```

2. Enter your directory
```bash
cd Hole-in-the-Ground-Source-Code
```

3. install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

4. run the program
```bash
npm run start
```
